NFL Draft Data Analyzation
-

Project Description: This project will be a thorough investigation into the past 29 drafts (1993-2022) and will answer questions such as:
   - How valuable is each draft pick?
  
   - Which college produces the best NFL players?
   
   - Which was the best draft class?
   
   - When do certain positions tend to get drafted?
   
   - When is the best time to draft certain positions?
   
   - etc...

The draft data is supplied by Pro Football Reference (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1993/draft.htm). The majority of the analyzation will be done through R and Microsoft Excel where I will create various visualizations, tables, and solutions with the data.

Project Progress: So far for the project I have gathered the draft data from Pro Football Reference from 1993-2022 and transferred it into RStudio where I am currently now working on making sure the data is clean for analyzation. I will then move forward with analyzing how valuable each draft pick is through R and then continue answering questions with this large dataset.
